# Camera Basics
This project including calibration and undistortion(including related operations like find chessboard corners) using OpenCv functions, as well as Zhang's method implemented by me.

The results of calibration via two methods are almost the same, witch suggests the method behind OpenCv calibration function may be Zhang's method.
### Notice
Download all the pictures, which are the original data I used.

If you want to test results by running my code, change the relative path of .txt files in your own PC(or just see "calibration results.txt").

If you want to see chess board corners in each picture, delete the "#" in line 36.

If you want to see pictures after undistortion, delete the "#" in line 57
